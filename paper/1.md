##### i. Paper Details
Apel, S., Speidel, H., Wendler, P., von Rhein, A., & Beyer, D. (2011). Detection of feature interactions using feature-aware verification. In 2011 26th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering (ASE 2011) (pp. 372â€“375). IEEE. http://doi.org/10.1109/ASE.2011.6100075

#####ii. Keywords and Definitions  
<b>ii1. Software product line</b>
A software product line is a family of software products that share a common set of features and differ in others. For example, one software can be published in different editions, such as basic edition, flagship edition or ultimate edition. They share a common set of features but do have many differences.

<b> ii2. Feature interaction</b>
A feature interaction is a situation in which the composition of multiple features leads to error or other situations. For example, a telephone line offers two features: call forwarding and call waiting. If one call comes during another call is on, the system has to decision which feature/function should be applied--it can forward the call to secondary person or let the first coming call wait.

<b> ii3. Product-line-verification</b>   
Product line verification is try to verify that all products of a product line satisfy their specification.

<b> ii4. Feature aware verification</b>   
Feature aware verification uses the product line verification techniques and supports the specification of feature properties, along with the features in separate or composable units.

##### iii. Brief notes  
<b> iii1. Motivational Statements</b>  
Many researchers are  trying to explore how to detect the feature interactions. There are two challenges here. First is to detect feature interactions based on specifications that do not have global system knowledge. Another one is to detect feature interaction without the need of generating and checking all individual products. 

<b> iii2. Hypotheses</b>  
In this paper, the authors try to detect the feature interactions automatically through the product-line-verification techniques. Since many researchers focus on the product-line-verification problem, they may provide a method to solve the feature interaction problem. 

<b> iii3. Baseline results</b>  
In the "CASE STUDY" section, the author used the brute-force approach as the basic line. That is, check ALL the products individually and figure them out separately.

<b> iii4. Related Work</b>  
In this paper, the author put the "Related work" at the second lastest section. This is because there is no so many connections between these works and this paper. The related works just provide another view/method to the similar problem.

One approach proposed first by Li et al. is verifying features modulary based on formal transition systems and CTL. Another approach is try to talk the product-line variablity into account.

##### iv. Three ways the paper could be improved.  
<b> iv1. Add the flow chart for data processing</b>  
I think one of defects in this paper is the lack of flow chart. In the whole paper, all the processes are expressed in text. If one flow chart can be added into section II, that will be much clearier.

<b> iv2. Include some essential knowledge in the former work</b>  
In the tool suite SPLVERIFIER, many former models were used, such as FEATUREHOUSE, CPAchecker. However, in this paper, the author only gave the reference to these tools. I think some basic knowledge about these former models should be given, such as the input/output of algorithms inside these models, etc.

<b> iv3. List the final comparison/results</b>   
This paper is a conference paper and it introduces their tool suite SPLVERIFIER. Consequently, they focused on the main function and the structure of the tool. However, in order to make the paper more persuasive, listing the final result in some way, such as table, figures, is essential.
